        <h1>Data</h1>
        <p>Computer programs require data in order to function. In this workshop, we'll look at how 
            to store data in our programs, and what different types of data there is.
        </p> 

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>A variable is a piece of memory that we allocate in which to store information. The memory 
                system is fairly complex so we give our piece of memory a friendly name so we can access it
                easily. Have a look at this program.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let myName = "Jimi";
let age = 30;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The keyword <span class="highlight">let</span> tells the browser that I'm goin to create a 
                variable and to free up some memory for me to use.
            </p>
            <p> I then give my piece of memory a friendly name, <span class="highlight">myName</span> and <span class="highlight">age</span> are the variable names.</p>
            <p> Then we use an <span class="highlight">=</span> sign. This is an assignment operator and I am about to assign a value to my variable.</p>
            <p> Lastly, I add my value and then end the operation with a semi-colon.</p>
            <p> The variables are stored in memory for use later on in the program and we can retrieve the 
                contents of those variables by using their names. For example, we could send them to the 
                console log.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let myName = "Jimi";
let age = 30;

console.log(myName);
console.log(age);

console.log (myName, age); 
            </code></pre>
            <p>The console log will print the contents of the variable, not the variable name itself. You can 
                also send multiple variables to the console log at once by separating them with commas.
            </p>

        </div> 

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Changing Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are so named as they can change their values. Let's have a look at this program.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let myName = "Jimi";
let age = 30;

console.log(myName);
console.log(age);

age = 40;
console.log(age);
            </code></pre>
            <p>In this program, the value of age has been updated. We did not need to use the <span class="highlight">let</span> 
            keyword again as the variable name had already been declared. variables can be updated.</p>
        </div>  

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Constant</h2>
            <p>For variables that should not change their values, we use a special variable called <span class="highlight">const</span> 
                and this will make the variable immutable. it can't be overwritten.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let myName = "Jimi";
const age = 30;

console.log(myName);
console.log(age);

age = 40;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Try changing the age variable from let to const. What happens when you try to update a constant?</p>
            <p>A TypeError occurs when you attempt to update a variable with information it can not hold. This 
                error tells you that you cannot assign to a constant variable. 
            </p>
            <p>Using const allows JavaScript to understand that this piece of memory will not change. In small 
                programs, there is not much difference, but in large systems, it can improve overall efficiency. 
                It is good practice!
            </p>
        </div>  

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Var</h2>
            <p>You may see in some text books that <span class="highlight">var</span> is used to declare variables. While 
                this is acceptable to use, it is from an old version of JavaScript. Modern JavaScript should only use 
                <span class="highlight">let</span> or <span class="highlight">const</span>.
            </p>
        </div>  

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Variable Names and Naming Conventions</h2>
            <p>For naming of variables, we follow the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/JavaScript#variable_names" target="_blank">official documentation</a>.
               This is to ensure good practice and standardisation.</p>
            <p>Variable names can only contain numbers, letters, underscores and dollar signs. However, it must never start with 
                a number.
            </p>
            <p>Variable names should use camelCase - start with a lowercase letter and then use uppercase for each following word. 
                Variable names can not contain spaces.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
/* Examples of good variable names */
let car = "volkswagon";
let playerScore = 400;
let speed = distance / time;
let cashInDollars = 45
            </code></pre>
            <p>Lastly, it is good practice to name your variables so they are descriptive and can be identified easily in 
                the context of the code. Your code forms part of your technical documentation and it should be understandable 
                by other coders.

            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <p>In the previous examples, there were two variables, <span class="highlight">myName</span> and <span class="highlight">age</span>
               and myName held information within quote marks, but age didn't. This is because text and numbers are different data types. Let's take
               a look at some of the primitive data types that JavaScript uses.
            </p>
            <h3>Number</h3>
            <p>In JavaScript, the number datatype represents numeric values. This includes Integers(whole numbers) and Reals(Any number with a decimal point).</p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let integerValue = -5;  // Integers are whole numbers.
console.log(integerValue);

let realValue = 3.14; // Real numbers are numbers with decimal points. 
console.log(realValue);
            </code></pre>        
            <h3>Boolean</h3>
            <p>A boolean value only holds one bit of data, and that is either a 1 or a 0. For programming we know this as true or false. Booleans are mainly used for conditional statements. It can also be used as switches.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let lightSwitch = true;  // the light is on.
console.log(lightSwitch);

lightSwitch = false;     // the light is now off
console.log(lightSwitch);
            </code></pre>      

            <h3>String</h3>
            <p>A string data type is a row of text within quote marks. Strings are stored in memory as a sequence of characters.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let fruit = "apple";
console.log(fruit);

let country = "Denmark";
console.log(country);

let phrase = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.";
console.log(phrase);
            </code></pre>   
            <h3>Null</h3>
            <p>The Null datatype represents 'no value' or 'nothing.' It is different to 0 as 0 is a value (an integer). Null is the absense of any positive, negative, and zero value. Null is empty memory.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let noNumber = null;
console.log(noNumber);
            </code></pre>   
            <h3>Undefined</h3>
            <p>The undefined data structure is reserved for unknown memory, or memory that has not been used - it does not even contain empty memory. </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let nothing; 
console.log(nothing);
            </code></pre> 
            <p>In this example, the variable is reserved, but JavaScript has no idea if it is a number, a string, or a boolean - it is undefined.</p>
            <h3>Others</h3>
            <p>There are other data structures that we will look at later in the module. Symbol, Object, BigInt, Arrays are all complex data structures. Feel free to look up these data structures.
            </p>

        <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
        <p>We've had a brief look at arithmetic before but it is important to see what this means in terms of 
            variables and memory. Let's take a look at the common arithmetic operators.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let num1 = 46;
let num2 = 32;

let sum = num1 + num2; // addition
let difference = num1 - num2; // subtraction
let product = num1 * num2; // multiplication
let quotient = num1 / num2; // division
let modulus = num1 % num2; // remainder.
let exponent = num1 ** num2; // to the power of.

num1++; // increment by 1.
num1--; // decrement by 1.
